<h3>About Me</h3>
<h4>My name is William Morton. I am 19 years old and currently pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science at Oregon State University with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence. While I don't have any current industry experience, I do have basic experience with several languages:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Python</li>
</ul>

<h4>I also have some experience with Linux based operating systems, machine learning in Python, managing and using cloud-based git repositories, and managing wireless networks. While these skills are not particularly refined at this moment, I am working to improve them and make myself an asset within the industry.</h4>
